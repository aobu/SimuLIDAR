# SimuLIDAR
SimuLIDAR is a LIDAR simulation tool using OpenCV that mimics real-world LIDAR scanning with noise. It generates point clouds from 2D maps, applies Canny edge detection and Hough Transform to extract line features, and reconstructs detailed maps. Ideal for robotics, SLAM, and computer vision projects.
